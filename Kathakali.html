		<p>O‘Kathakali’, an important genre in the Indian classical dance form, is associated with storytelling form of this art.</p>
		It is the dance drama from the south Indian state of Kerala. Similar to other Indian classical dance arts, the story</p>
		in ‘Kathakali’ is also communicated to audience through excellent footwork and impressive gestures of face and hands</p>
		complimented with music and vocal performance. However it can be distinguished from the others through the intricate </p>
		and vivid make-up, unique face masks and costumes worn by dancers as also from their style and movements that reflect </p>
		the age-old martial arts and athletic conventions prevalent in Kerala and surrounding regions. Traditionally performed </p>
		by male dancers, it developed in courts and theatres of Hindu regions contrary to other Indian classical dances which </p>
		predominantly developed in Hindu temples and monastic schools. Although not clearly traceable, this classical dance form</p>
		is considered to have originated from temple and folk arts that trace back to 1st millennium CE or before.</p>

		<br>
		<p>Author Phillip Zarrilli mentions that the basic components and distinct features of this form of classical dance can be</p>
		traced back to ancient Sanskrit Hindu text called ‘Natya Shastra’, a text on the performing arts written by the sage Bharata </p>
		Muni, an Indian theatrologist and musicologist. Although the full version of the text is conjectured to be completed between </p>
		200 BCE to 200 CE, such time span also hover around 500 BCE to 500 CE. Various chapters of this text consist of thousands of</p>
		verses. Dance is categorised in two specific forms in ‘Natya Shastra’ - ‘nrita’ and nritya’. While the former is pure</p>
		dance that concentrates on hand movements and gestures, the latter is solo expressive dance that showcases brilliance</p>
		of expressions. Natalia Lidova, a Russian scholar mentions that the text throws light upon different theories of Indian</p>
		classical dances that includes theories of Tandava dance, standing postures, basic steps, bhava, rasa, methods of acting</p>
		and gestures. Traditionally the name of this dance form was deduced by joining two words, ‘Katha’ and ‘Kali’ where </p>
		‘Katha’ in Sanskrit means a traditional tale or story and ‘Kali’ derived from ‘Kala’ refers to art and performance.</p>

		Views and opinions regarding the roots of ‘Kathakali’ vary due to its somewhat ambiguous background. While Jones and Ryan</p>
		mention that this genre of performing art dates back to over 500 years, according to Mahinder Singh its roots are way</p>
		more ancient dating back to around 1500 years. Zarrilli states that the 16th and 17th centuries witnessed development</p>
		of Kathakali as a unique form of classical dance in the coastal belt of southern India which have Malayalam speaking</p>
		populace.</p>
