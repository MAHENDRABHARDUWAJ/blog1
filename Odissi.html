		<h1><center>ODOSSI</center></h1>
		<p>Odissi or Orissi is one of the pre-eminent classical dance forms of India which originated in the Hindu temples of the</p>
		eastern coastal state of Odisha in India. Its theoretical base trace back to ‘Natya Shastra’, the ancient Sanskrit Hindu</p>
		text on the performing arts. Age-old tradition of Odissi is manifested from Odisha Hindu temples and various sites of </p>
		archaeological significance that are associated with Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism, the sculptures of which adorn</p>
		dance postures of this art form. A form of illustrative anecdote of mythical and religious stories, devotional poems</p>
		and spiritual ideas emoted by dancer with excellent body movements, expressions, impressive gestures and sign languages,</p>
		its performance repertoire includes invocation, nrita, nritya, natya, and moksha. This dance form includes themes from</p>
		Vaishnavism and others associated with Hindu gods and goddesses like Shiva, Surya and Shakti.</p>

		<p>The antiquity of this dance form is evident from its roots that trace back to the ancient Sanskrit Hindu text called </p>
		‘Natya Shastra’ which deals with different performing arts. All the 108 fundamental dance units elucidated in ‘Natya Shastra’</p>
		are similar to this art form. It encompasses thousands of verses that are structured in various chapters. Dance is divided</p>
		in two specific forms in this text namely ‘nrita’ and ‘nritya’. While ‘nrita’ is pure dance that focuses on perfection</p>
		of hand movements and gestures, ‘nritya’ is solo expressive dance that stresses on the aspects of expressions.</p>
		Natalia Lidova, a Russian scholar, says that the text enlightens on several theories of Indian classical dances includin</p>
		g that of Tandava dance of Lord Shiva, standing postures, basic steps, bhava, rasa, methods of acting and gestures.</p>
		Reference to four popular styles of vrittis that is methods of expressive presentations namely ‘Odra-Magadhi’, ‘Panchali’,</p>
		‘Dakshinatya’ and ‘Avanti’ is found in the text, of which Odra refers to this performing art.</p>

		Sites of archaeological and historical significance like caves and temples in Puri, Konarak and Bhubaneswar bear carvings</p>
		that are historical manifestations of ancient art forms like music and dance. The heritage site of Udayagiri, the largest</p>
		Buddhist complex in Odisha, houses the Manchapuri cave belongs to the reign of Kharavela, the Jaina king of Kalinga from </p>
		the Mahameghavahana dynasty who ruled sometime around the 1st or 2nd century BCE. The cave depicts carvings of musicians </p>
		and dance. Reference of music and dance are also found in Udayagiri’s Hathigumpha Inscriptions that were inscribed by Kharavela.</p>
		The antiquity of Odisha’s musical tradition is also palpable from the account of discovery of a lithophone by the archaeologists </p>
		that is made of polished basalt with 20 keys. It was unearthed in the archaeological site near Angul, Odisha called Sankarjang</p>
		that dates back to around 1000 BCE.</p>
