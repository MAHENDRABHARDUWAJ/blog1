		<h1><center>Kuchipudi</center></h1>
		<p>Kuchipudi, a pre-eminent Indian classical dance form counted among ten leading classical dance forms of India, is a</p>
		dance-drama performance art that originated in a village of Krishna district of Andhra Pradesh, India. Similar to all </p>
		leading Indian classical dance forms, Kuchipudi too evolved as a religious art rooting back to the age-old Hindu</p>
		Sanskrit text ‘Natya Shastra’ and connects traditionally with temples, spiritual faiths and travelling bards. </p>
		This ancient dance form finds place in the 10th century copper inscriptions and in 15th century texts like</p>
		‘Machupalli Kaifat’. Traditionally it is regarded that the sanyassin of Advaita Vedanta sect, Tirtha Narayana Yati,</p>
		and his disciple Siddhendra Yogi initiated, methodized and arranged the present day version of the dance form in 17th </p>
		century. Usually performance repertoire of Kuchipudi that is broadly oriented on Lord Krishna and the tradition of </p>
		Vaishnavism include an invocation, dharavu – short dance, nritta – pure dance and nritya – expressive dance respectively.</p>

		<br>
		<p>The theoretical foundation of Kuchipudi is rooted back to the ancient Sanskrit Hindu text on the performing arts called</p>
		‘Natya Shastra’ which is accredited to Indian theatrologist and musicologist Bharata Muni. It is assumed that the full</p>
		version of the text was first completed between 200 BCE to 200 CE, but such period also varies between 500 BCE and 500</p>
		CE. It incorporates verses in thousands that are structured in different chapters and divides dance in two distinct</p>
		types that are ‘nrita’ that is pure technical dance and ‘nritya’ that is solo expressive dance. ‘Natya Shastra’,</p>
		states Russian scholar Natalia Lidova, explicates various Indian classical dance theories including that of standing</p>
		postures, bhava, rasa, basic steps, methods of acting, gestures and Tandava dance, which is associated with Lord </p>
		Shiva. Bharata Muni not only mentions the Andhra region in this ancient text but also attributes an elegant movement</p>
		called ‘Kaishiki vritti’ and a raga called ‘Andhri’ to this region. The raga that is associated with ‘Arsabhi’ and</p>
		‘Gandhari’ also finds place in several other Sanskrit texts dating back to the 1st millennium.</p>

		One of the five great epics of Tamil Literature, ‘Silappatikaram’ (~2nd century CE) has a direct reference to</p>
		this dance form. The Shiva temple of Kanchipuram that is decorated with carvings dating back to a period between</p>
		6th to 9th centuries CE manifests the development of this dance form by around the mid first millennium CE. Many</p>
		ancient Hindu temples are embellished with sculptures of Lord Shiva in Bharatanatyam dance poses. The eastern gopuram</p>
		of the 12th century Thillai Natarajar Temple, Chidambaram, of Tamil Nadu dedicated to Lord Shiva bears sculptures</p>
		depicting 108 poses of Bharatanatyam, referred as karanas in ‘Natya Shastra’, that are intricately carved in small</p>
		rectangular panels. Another notable sculpture can be seen in the Cave 1 of Karnataka’s Badami cave temples dating</p>
		back to the 7th century where a 5 feet tall sculpture of Lord Shiva is depicted as Nataraja doing Tandava dance.</p>
		The 18 arms of the Shiva sculpture expresses mudras or hand gestures that are part of Bharatanatyam.</p>
