		<p>
		To begin to understand the Mohiniyattam dance, one must first understand its origin. The meaning of Mohiniyattam begins with 
		the figure Mohini, the female avatar of Vishnu. Mohini is a supreme enchantress who uses her femininity to gain the advantage
		for good against evil. Mohini comes from the verb root moha, meaning to perplex or cause delusion. This classical Indian dance
		tradition has embodied the essence of female beauty and allurement for centuries and continues to be widely performed today.

		<p>
		With ancient roots, Mohiniyattam is a dance that showcases the graceful, gentle, and cunning aspects of the female form.</P>
		It is traditionally and primarily performed by women but has been studied and performed by people of all genders.</P>
		This dance style is used to emote a story through various forms of precise movement. Although the movements involved</P>
		have been taught throughout the years in a standardized format, this art form remains firmly grounded in creativity,</P>
		interpretation, and emotion.</P>

		This style of dance evolved in Kerala, whose temple structures are the earliest manifestations of feminine Mohiniyattam</P>
		poses. Today, the practice and performance of the Mohiniyattam dance remain a vital point of the culture. This dance is </P>
		performed in private recitals and in public gatherings to encourage tourism, honor tradition, celebrate, and respect the </P>
		female form.

		In the Puranic epic Mahābhārata, Lord Vishnu took the form of Mohini to seduce and beguile Asuras—beings in opposition to </p>
		gods. Lord Vishnu, as Mohini, appears in many stories using her wit and beauty to beguile and conquer her enemies. </p>
		Mohiniyattam as a classical dance tradition originated from the writings of Bharata Muni. The first complete compilation </p>
		of texts defining Mohiniyattam dance the Natya Shastra, dated 200 BCE. The text explains the most basic of elements utilized </p>
		in the two classical forms of dance—the high-energy and vigorous Tandava dance of Shiva, as well as the gentle, calm and</p>
		graceful Lasya dance of Parvati. Mohiniyattam more closely follows the structure and intent of the Lasya dance in the Natya Shastra text.</p>
