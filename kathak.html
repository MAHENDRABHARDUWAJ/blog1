		<h1><center>KATHAK</center></h1>
		<p>Kathak is one of the main genres of ancient Indian classical dance and is traditionally regarded to have originated from the </p>
		travelling bards of North India referred as Kathakars or storytellers. These Kathakars wandered around and communicated legendary</p>
		stories via music, dance and songs quite like the early Greek theatre. The genre developed during the Bhakti movement,</p>
		the trend of theistic devotion which evolved in medieval Hinduism. The Kathakars communicate stories through rhythmic </p>
		foot movements, hand gestures, facial expressions and eye work. This performing art that incorporates legends from </p>
		ancient mythology and great Indian epics, especially from the life of Lord Krishna became quite popular in the courts</p>
		of North Indian kingdoms. Three specific forms of this genre that is three gharanas (schools), which mostly differ in</p>
		emphasis given to footwork versus acting, are more famous namely, the Jaipur gharana, the Benaras gharana and the </p>
		Lucknow gharana.</p>

		<p>The roots of this dance form trace back to Sanskrit Hindu text on performing arts called ‘Natya Shastra’ written by ancient</p>
		Indian theatrologist and musicologist Bharata Muni. It is presumed that the first complete version of the text was completed </p>
		between 200 BCE to 200 CE, but some sources mention the timeframe to be around 500 BCE and 500 CE. Thousands of verses structured</p>
		in different chapters are found in the text that divides dance in two particular forms, namely ‘nrita’ that is pure</p>
		dance which comprise of finesse of hand movements and gestures, and ‘nritya’ that is solo expressive dance that </p>
		focuses on expressions.</p>

		One of the five great epics of Tamil Literature, ‘Silappatikaram’ (~2nd century CE) has a direct reference to</p>
		this dance form. The Shiva temple of Kanchipuram that is decorated with carvings dating back to a period between</p>
		6th to 9th centuries CE manifests the development of this dance form by around the mid first millennium CE. Many</p>
		ancient Hindu temples are embellished with sculptures of Lord Shiva in Bharatanatyam dance poses. The eastern gopuram</p>
		of the 12th century Thillai Natarajar Temple, Chidambaram, of Tamil Nadu dedicated to Lord Shiva bears sculptures</p>
		depicting 108 poses of Bharatanatyam, referred as karanas in ‘Natya Shastra’, that are intricately carved in small</p>
		rectangular panels. Another notable sculpture can be seen in the Cave 1 of Karnataka’s Badami cave temples dating</p>
		back to the 7th century where a 5 feet tall sculpture of Lord Shiva is depicted as Nataraja doing Tandava dance.</p>
		The 18 arms of the Shiva sculpture expresses mudras or hand gestures that are part of Bharatanatyam.</p>
