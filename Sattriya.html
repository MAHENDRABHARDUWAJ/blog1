		<h1><center>Sattriya</center></h1>
		<p>Sattriya Nritya was created by Sankardeva to accompany the Ankiya Naat (a sort of Assamese one-act drama invented by him),</p>
		which were mainly performed in the sattras, as Assam's monasteries are named. As the convention expanded and evolved with </p>
		the sattras, the dancing style became known as Sattriya Nritya.</p>

		<p>Sattriya Dances' essential position differs from that of all other classical dances in India. Males adopt the Purush Pak</p>
		position during the dance, while girls use the Prakriti Pak posture.</p>

The dance honours several legendary creatures. They do complicated dances and steps, and several vocalists write sections of </p>
the songs. 'Borgeet,' Assamese traditional music, is played during these dances.</p>

Sattriya dances like Ankiya Bhaona and Ojapali, in which the lead vocalist performs while singing, are known as 'abhinaya,' </p>
or the art of telling stories.</p>

		The Sattras maintained severe deprivations and devotion within their confines until the first decade of the nineteenth</p>
		century. Male dancers alone conduct this dance in a highly committed and spiritual manner. Many reasons may have </p>
		attributed to Sattriya Nritya's delayed acceptance and recognition. One of the main benefits of following the rules</p>
		of the sattras has been the capacity to preserve its original form and distinct style.</p>
