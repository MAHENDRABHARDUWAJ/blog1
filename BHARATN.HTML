		<p>Bharatanatyam, a pre-eminent Indian classical dance form presumably the oldest classical dance heritage of India</p>
		is regarded as mother of many other Indian classical dance forms. Conventionally a solo dance performed only by women,</p>
		it initiated in the Hindu temples of Tamil Nadu and eventually flourished in South India. Theoretical base of this</p>
		form traces back to ‘Natya Shastra’, the ancient Sanskrit Hindu text on the performing arts.</p>
		A form of illustrative anecdote of Hindu religious themes and spiritual ideas emoted by dancer with excellent footwork</p>
		and impressive gestures its performance repertoire includes nrita, nritya and natya. Accompanists include a singer,</p>
		music and particularly the guru who directs and conducts the performance. It also continues to inspire several art </p>
		forms including paintings and sculptures starting from the spectacular 6th to 9th century CE temple sculptures. </p>

		<p>According to the Hindu tradition the name of the dance form was derived by joining two words, ‘Bharata’ and Natyam’</p>
		where ‘Natyam in Sanskrit means dance and ‘Bharata’ is a mnemonic comprising ‘bha’, ‘ra’ and ‘ta’ which respectively means</p>
		‘bhava’ that is emotion and feelings; ‘raga’ that is melody; and ‘tala’ that is rhythm. Thus, traditionally the word</p> 
		refers to a dance form where bhava, raga and tala are expressed. The theoretical base of this dance form, which is</p>
		also referred as Sadir, trace back to ancient Indian theatrologist and musicologist, Bharata Muni’s Sanskrit Hindu </p>
		text on the performing arts called ‘Natya Shastra’. The text’s first complete version was presumably completed </p>
		between 200 BCE to 200 CE, however such timeframe also varies between 500 BCE and 500 CE. According to legends Lord</p>
		Brahma revealed Bharatanatyam to the sage Bharata who then encoded this holy dance form in Natya Shastra. The text</p>
		that consists of thousands of verses structured in different chapters divides dance in two specific forms, namely</p>
		‘nrita’ that is pure dance comprising of finesse of hand movements and gestures, and ‘nritya’ that is solo expressive</p>
		dance that comprises of expressions. According to Russian scholar Natalia Lidova, ‘Natya Shastra’ elucidates several</p>
		theories of Indian classical dances including that of Tandava dance, standing postures, basic steps, bhava, rasa,</p>
		methods of acting and gestures.</p>

		One of the five great epics of Tamil Literature, ‘Silappatikaram’ (~2nd century CE) has a direct reference to</p>
		this dance form. The Shiva temple of Kanchipuram that is decorated with carvings dating back to a period between</p>
		6th to 9th centuries CE manifests the development of this dance form by around the mid first millennium CE. Many</p>
		ancient Hindu temples are embellished with sculptures of Lord Shiva in Bharatanatyam dance poses. The eastern gopuram</p>
		of the 12th century Thillai Natarajar Temple, Chidambaram, of Tamil Nadu dedicated to Lord Shiva bears sculptures</p>
		depicting 108 poses of Bharatanatyam, referred as karanas in ‘Natya Shastra’, that are intricately carved in small</p>
		rectangular panels. Another notable sculpture can be seen in the Cave 1 of Karnataka’s Badami cave temples dating</p>
		back to the 7th century where a 5 feet tall sculpture of Lord Shiva is depicted as Nataraja doing Tandava dance.</p>
		The 18 arms of the Shiva sculpture expresses mudras or hand gestures that are part of Bharatanatyam.</p>
