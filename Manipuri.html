		<h1><center>Manipuri</center></h1>
		<p>Manipuri dance is counted among major classical dance forms of India, especially noted for themes based on Vaishnavism </p>
		and spectacular execution of ‘Ras Lila’, dance dramas based on love between Radha and Krishna. Other themes included in this </p>
		art form associate with Shaktism, Shaivism and on the sylvan deities called Umang Lai during Manipuri festival ‘Lai Haraoba’.</p>
		This dance form is named after the north-eastern state of Manipur, India from where it originated but it has its roots in </p>
		‘Natya Shastra’, the age-old Sanskrit Hindu text. A mix of Indian and southeast Asian culture is palpable in this form. The</p>
		age-old dance tradition of the place is manifested from great Indian epics, ‘Ramayana’ and ‘Mahabharata’, where the native </p>
		dance experts of Manipur are referred as ‘Gandharvas’. The Manipuris perform this religious art that aims at expressing spiritual</p>
		values during Hindu festivals and other important cultural occasions like marriage.</p>

		<p>Traditionally the Manipuri people consider themselves to be the ‘Gandharvas’ mentioned in the Vedic texts who were singers,</p>
		dancers and musicians associated with devas or the deities. Southeast Asian temples of early medieval period bear sculptures of</p>
		‘Gandharvas’ as dancers. The region is also mentioned as ‘Gandharva-desa’ in ancient Manipuri texts. Usha, the exalted dawn </p>
		goddess in the ‘Rig Veda’ is traditionally accredited of creating female dance art and tutoring girls in the art. </p>
		Conventionally this oral tradition of dance passed down verbally to women is famous in Manipur as ‘Chingkheirol’. Manipur </p>
		finds place in age-old Sanskrit texts including the great Indian epic, the ‘Mahabharata’, which mentions that one of the</p>
		five Pandava brothers, Arjun met Chitrangada and fell in love with her in this beautiful valley. The ethnic majority </p>
		of Meitei people call dance as ‘Jagoi’ and the traditional ‘Lai Haraoba’ festival observed in honour of the sylvan deities </p>
		called Umang Lai includes several dance postures of Nataraja, an illustration of Lord Shiva as the cosmic ecstatic dancer,</p>
		as also His disciple Tandu or Tangkhu. The ‘Khamba Thoibi’ dance is performed during ‘Lai Haraoba’. It is a duet dance of </p>
		male and female partners that is dedicated to the sylvan deity, Thangjing of Moiran, and associated with the Manipuri folklore</p> 
		of two lovers an orphan boy Khamba and a princess Thoibi, daughter of King Chinkhuba, from the epic ‘Moirang Parba’. </p>

		Although texts of ancient Manipur gradually fizzled out, the oral tradition of Manipuri, records tracing back to early 18th </p>
		century, have references about the place in Asian manuscripts and archaeological findings speak volumes about the art. The</p>
		text ‘Bamon Khunthok’ that gives an account of migration of Hindu Brahmins and Buddhists to Manipur elucidates that </p>
		the practice of Vaishnavism was embraced by Manipur Kings during the 15th century CE. Later, Vaishnavism was not only </p>
		adopted by King Charai Rongba in 1704 but was also declared as the state religion.</p>
